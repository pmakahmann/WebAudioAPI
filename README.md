About:

Welcome to the RogueMiddleChild.com Repository.  I have designed this website as an introductory portal into my current progress as Web Designer, as well as a short showcase of my work as a musician, composer, and theorist over the last 18 years.

Contains:
The webDesigner page features some of my sample web designs.  Most are front-end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  The AboutSchenker page is my first posted PHP site using Twig templates.  The games page features my first foray into game design, a basic text-driven JavaScript game written for a co-worker.  There are also music, video, and PDF documents of past performances, compositions, and theoretical writings.

Viewing:

1) The easiest way to view the finished work is to visit www.roguemiddlechild.com.
2) You could download or clone the files and begin by opening index.html in a browser or editor.

Limitations:

Although nothing on this page is extremely personal, I would appreciate anyone viewing this site to not redistribute any of my compositions or theoretical writings without first seeking permission.

Contact:

I am available for questions and comments at rk@roguemiddlechild.com.

Thanks for visiting my repository.  Come back soon as I continue to add content and "class-up" the styling.
